GCC for RISC-V Architecture.

## Overview

This repository provides a beginner-friendly introduction to RISC-V architecture and a guide for building GCC as a cross-compiler for RISC-V. It serves as a practical resource for students, developers, and enthusiasts interested in working with this open instruction set architecture.

## What's Inside

- **Introduction to Computer Architecture**: Simplified explanations of processor architecture and instruction sets
- **RISC-V Basics**: Clear explanation of what RISC-V is and how it differs from other architectures
- **Cross-Compilation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for building a RISC-V GCC cross-compiler
- **Environment Setup**: Instructions for configuring your system to use the RISC-V toolchain

## Getting Started

Check out the [documentation](document.md) for a comprehensive guide covering:
- Computer architecture fundamentals
- Instruction set architecture (ISA) concepts
- RISC-V architecture details
- Building GCC for RISC-V from source
- Setting up your development environment

## Why RISC-V?

RISC-V is a free, open-source instruction set architecture that enables anyone to build custom processors without licensing restrictions. Unlike proprietary architectures like x86 or ARM, RISC-V offers:

- Complete openness and customizability
- Simple and modern design principles
- Freedom from licensing fees
- Growing ecosystem of tools and support

## Prerequisites

Basic understanding of:
- C programming
- Linux command line
- Compilation concepts
