.SH NAME
gdb\-add\-index \- Add index files to speed up GDB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
gdb-add-index [\-dwarf\-5] \fIfilename\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
When GDB finds a symbol file, it scans the symbols in the
file in order to construct an internal symbol table.  This lets most
GDB operations work quickly\-\-at the cost of a delay early on.
For large programs, this delay can be quite lengthy, so GDB
provides a way to build an index, which speeds up startup.
.PP
To determine whether a file contains such an index, use the command
\&\f(CW\*(C`readelf \-S filename\*(C'\fR: the index is stored in a section named
\&\f(CW\*(C`.gdb_index\*(C'\fR (pre-DWARF 5) or \f(CW\*(C`.debug_names\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`.debug_str\*(C'\fR (DWARF 5).  Indexes can only be produced on systems
which use ELF binaries and DWARF debug information (i.e., sections
named \f(CW\*(C`.debug_*\*(C'\fR).
.PP
By default \fBgdb-add-index\fR will add a pre-DWARF 5
\&\f(CW\*(C`.gdb_index\*(C'\fR section to \fIfilename\fR.  With \fB\-dwarf\-5\fR
DWARF 5 sections are added instead.
.PP
\&\fIfilename\fR must be writable.
.PP
\&\fBgdb-add-index\fR uses GDB, \fBobjcopy\fR, and
\&\fBreadelf\fR found in the \fBPATH\fR environment variable.  If
you want to use different versions of these programs, you can specify
them through the appropriate environment variables (see below).
.PP
\&\fBgdb-add-index\fR exits with status 0 if it succeeds in creating
the index for \fIfilename\fR or greater than 0 if an error occurs.
.PP
See more in
the GDB manual in node \f(CW\*(C`Index Files\*(C'\fR
\&\-\- shell command \f(CW\*(C`info \-f gdb \-n "Index Files"\*(C'\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP \fB\-dwarf\-5\fR 4
.IX Item "-dwarf-5"
Add DWARF 5 sections instead of previous \f(CW\*(C`.debug_index\*(C'\fR section.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
.IP \fBGDB\fR 4
.IX Item "GDB"
Full file name of the \f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR program to use for index generation.
If not set, the \fBPATH\fR will be searched for a \f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR program.
.IP \fBOBJCOPY\fR 4
.IX Item "OBJCOPY"
Full file name of the \f(CW\*(C`objcopy\*(C'\fR program to use to copy section
information into the given file.  If not set, the \fBPATH\fR will be searched
for a \f(CW\*(C`objcopy\*(C'\fR program.
.IP \fBREADELF\fR 4
.IX Item "READELF"
Full file name of the \f(CW\*(C`readelf\*(C'\fR program to use to inspect
properties of the given file.  If not set, the \fBPATH\fR will be searched
for a \f(CW\*(C`readelf\*(C'\fR program.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IX Header "SEE ALSO"
The full documentation for GDB is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
If the \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR programs and GDB's Texinfo
documentation are properly installed at your site, the command
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        info gdb
.Ve
.PP
should give you access to the complete manual.
